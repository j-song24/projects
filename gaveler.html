            <p> Many people know about the Brock Turner case, but how many people know who the acting judge was? Who was the person responsible for the ruling? Let's say you have a hearing with a judge at your local county court for a traffic violation. Would you want to see other people's experiences with this judge? Whether or not they were fair and respectful?</p>
            <p>At Dog and Rooster, I worked on redesigning a current in-house app called Gaveler. The idea behind the app was to help users share their experiences about judges and cases. Currently, there isn’t a way for people to effectively express their opinions. Sure, there are applications like Yelp, that allow users to rate restaurants and establishments, but judges are rarely under scrutiny and critique by the general public.</p>

          <h3> User Testing</h3>
          <p>In order to make sure that the prototype fit the needs of the users, I created a list of tasks I wanted the users to focus on and led think-aloud protocols for each of the user testers to see where they struggled/found success. Mapping out user flows helped me understand which interactions needed to be fixed.</p>

              <blockquote class="takeaway-text">01</blockquote>
                <p class="takeaway-text"> Posting process is inconsistent. When tasked with posting an experience/Q&A, they were confused about where to go.</p>

          <h3> Final Product</h3>  
            <p>Using the feedback I got from user testing, I fixed three main things:</p>
              <li>All posting is done using “+” button on the bottom banner.</li>
              <li>Limiting who can post a shared experience by adding a verification process and an information link.</li>
              <li>Creating a tutorial during onboarding to introduce features of the app, including the icons on the bottom banner.</li>
            <p> All other features and pages remain the same.</p>
