            <h4> Background </h4>
            <p>Many people know about the Brock Turner case, but how many people really know who the judge was? Who was the person responsible for the ruling? Maybe you have a hearing with a judge at a local county court for a traffic violation? Would you want to see how well they’re rated by other people?</p>

            <p>
            At Dog and Rooster, I worked on redesigning a current in-house app called Gaveler. The idea behind the app was to help users share their experiences about judges and cases. Currently, there isn’t a way for people to effectively express their opinions. Sure, there are applications like Yelp, that allow users to rate restaurants and establishments, but judges are rarely under scrutiny and critique by the general public. </p>

            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>Our research on related products and platforms in this space focused on web and mobile applications that had the mission of connecting artists with fans or booking agencies. With this focus, the platforms we examined for competitive analysis and to inform our own app design wereICONN, SongKick, BandsInTown, and SoundCloud. From these platforms our team realized that few platforms focused on smaller, independent, artists. Most site or apps primarily targeted bigger established names and the fans of those established artists. Additionally, very few of these existing platforms facilitated an environment or interaction where social connection could happen through or as a result of  the music. Of these platforms, SoundCloud fulfilled these criteria the best. SoundCloud effectively promotes independent artists by making it easy to upload and share music. The SoundCloud platform also encourages listener feedback and community engagement  by allowing the listener to comment on certain sections or timestamps in the song. Because Sound Cloud does both of these effectively, is is the app we chose to primarily engage with when designing our own approach to social connectivity and community engagement through hearsay. </p>

            <h4> User Testing </h4>
            <p>We developed a survey for concert goers and an interview for artists.</p>

            <p>The first part of the survey asks if people would consider themselves, “concert goers,” or not. For the purpose of the survey, we defined a “concert goer” as someone who attends at least three or more concerts per year. From there, we ask how they normally find out about concerts and how they find out about new local artists performances. We also inquire about what current ticketing platforms they use in order to book their tickets for concerts and if they would use current platforms for finding out about concerts or buying tickets if they were more easy to use. The last part of our survey targets the interactions between concert goers and artists; we ask how they currently provide feedback and how important it is to engage socially with the local music community.</p>

            <p>For local artists, we decided to conduct in-depth interviews rather than a survey. We asked questions about classifying them as artists (ex. genre, fan size), advertising practices and preferences, openness to feedback, importance of community, positive/negative experiences, and their plans going forward.</p>

            <h4> Lo-Fi Prototype </h4>
            <p> For our initial prototype, we focused on the onboarding and profile configuration experience of a new user.</p>

            <img class="detail-image" src="./images/hearsay/hearsay4.png"><br>
            <p> We created a feature that promotes social connection more so than a comments or feedback page would. Our "heartbeat" feature allows concert goers to provide real time feedback to the music. By monitoring the spikes in the person's heart rate, users can upload their in-the-moment  reaction to the music. Users could connect a smartwatch or fitbit to the app, and during concerts, add their heart rate to the concert insight page of the artist's event to show how engaged or excited the audience was during a specific moment of the performance. This allows artists to understand which parts of their performances are especially stimulating to their audience.

            <h4> Takeaways </h4>
            <p> A main goal for this project was to find a unexplored way to tackle social interaction. It was challenging to find ways to foster social chatter besides using the standard "feed" or "chatroom." We loved the idea of real time interaction with the "heartbeat" feature. However, we would like to expand further by adding an annotation feature. This would allow users to retrospectively "tag" their own hearbeats by adding notes about their experience at a particular segment of their heartbeat. Overall, this project challenged me to find out-of-the-box ways to encourage social interaction using unconventional features. </p>
