            <h3> Background </h3>
            <p>Many people know about the Brock Turner case, but how many people know who the acting judge was? Who was the person responsible for the ruling? Let's say you have a hearing with a judge at your local county court for a traffic violation. Would you want to see other people's experiences with this judge? Whether or not they were fair and respectful?</p>

            <p>
            At Dog and Rooster, I worked on redesigning a current in-house app called Gaveler. The idea behind the app was to help users share their experiences about judges and cases. Currently, there isnâ€™t a way for people to effectively express their opinions. Sure, there are applications like Yelp, that allow users to rate restaurants and establishments, but judges are rarely under scrutiny and critique by the general public. </p>

            <p> This experience has been extremely rewarding and interesting. I plan on continuing this project, especially with regards to user testing. The next step for this project is to conduct user tests and observe user actions. I would like to continue to update this app and create a more comprehensive application that is centered around the user's needs!</p>
