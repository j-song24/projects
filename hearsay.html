            <p> We created an application that provides local music artists the opportunity to market events, gather feedback from local concert goers and connect to their audences. An application that allows local concert goers to discover new artists in their area, provide feedback to their favorite artists and create social bonds in person and online.</p>

          <h3> Concertgoer Research</h3>
          <p>Next, we wanted to understand how people currently looked for local shows and some of the platforms they used. We put out a survey with questions like:" Do you consider yourself a concert goer?" For the purpose of the survey, we defined a “concert goer” as someone who attends at least three or more concerts per year. From there, we ask how they normally find out about concerts and how they find out about new local artists performances. We also inquired about what current ticketing platforms they use in order to book their tickets for concerts and if they would use current platforms for finding out about concerts or buying tickets if they were more easy to use. The last part of our survey targets the interactions between concert goers and artists; we ask how they currently provide feedback, how important it is to engage socially with the local music community, and if they would be interested in an app that allowed them to provide feedback and find out about local performances in an easy way.</p>
          <p>Using the information we got from our surveys, I created a user journey flow to understand how people currently find concerts to attend.</p>

          <p>For local artists, we decided to conduct in-depth interviews rather than a survey. We asked questions about classifying them as artists (ex. genre, fan size), advertising practices and preferences, openness to feedback, importance of community, positive/negative experiences, and their plans going forward. Since we chose an interview format, we left most of the questions open-ended, which led to very rich findings and quotes. We were aiming for 5 interviews, and we were lucky enough to accomplish this with a variety of students and locals.</p>

Without this recognition or following online, it makes it tremendously difficult for these local artists to book their first concert or show because venue owners aren’t willing to take risks on an artist that may or may not have a lot of fans.</p>

          <p>Our research on related products and platforms in this space focused on web and mobile applications that had the mission of connecting artists with fans or booking agencies. With this focus, the platforms we examined for competitive analysis and to inform our own app design wereICONN, SongKick, BandsInTown, and SoundCloud. From these platforms our team realized that few platforms focused on smaller, independent, artists. Most site or apps primarily targeted bigger established names and the fans of those established artists. Additionally, very few of these existing platforms facilitated an environment or interaction where social connection could happen through or as a result of the music. Of these platforms, SoundCloud fulfilled these criteria the best. SoundCloud effectively promotes independent artists by making it easy to upload and share music. The SoundCloud platform also encourages listener feedback and community engagement by allowing the listener to comment on certain sections or timestamps in the song. Because Sound Cloud does both of these effectively, is is the app we chose to primarily engage with when designing our own approach to social connectivity and community engagement through hearsay.

          <p>In our first low-fidelity prototype, we had four screens: a sign up screen, a log-in screen, an artist selection screen, and an artist home page. In order to test the concert goers on these initial screens, we conducted a cognitive walkthrough so that we could examine whether the initial screens of our app were intuitive or not. Throughout all of the testing we asked users to think-aloud so that we would be able to hear how they were feeling about our app and if the direction was clear. We began by asking the user to sign up on the first screen and we would manually change it to the next screen once the user had signed up correctly; if a user was not correct or wondered something about the screens, we encouraged them to ask and wrote down concerns/confusions. From there, we asked users to select their favorite artists. On the final screen, we asked concert goer users to walk us through each section of the artist profile; we then followed up with them to see if it was lacking any features that could improve its usage.</p>
          <p>The same process was carried out for artists. We displayed our initial screens and described what the interactions would look like for both parties. During this stage, we were given very feedback (described later on) that was very influential in our final prototype.</p>

          <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p> A main goal for this project was to find a unexplored way to tackle social interaction. It was challenging to find ways to foster social chatter besides using the standard "feed" or "chatroom." We loved the idea of real time interaction with the "heartbeat" feature. However, we would like to expand further by adding an annotation feature. This would allow users to retrospectively "tag" their own hearbeats by adding notes about their experience at a particular segment of their heartbeat. Overall, this project challenged me to find out-of-the-box ways to encourage social interaction using unconventional features. </p>
