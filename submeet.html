            <h3> Background Research</h3>
                <p> Subletting has always been a challenge. How do you determine if someone is trustworthy enough to stay at your home? How do you know if the subletter will return your security deposit at the end of your stay? We wanted to find out a better way to pair subletters and subleasers by exploring the theme of trust and verification in our application design. But before we started brainstorming, we wanted to understand how CMU students currently find subletters/subleasers.</p>

            <h3> Research </h3>
            <p> The research we conducted was a multi step process. First, we conducted a competitive analysis to understand the current solutions. Using what we learned, we then created a <a href="./images/submeet/submeet background interview.pdf" target= "_BLANK">list</a> of questions to ask during interviews. We asked these questions to get a grasp of how users currently experienced subletting/subleasing.

                    <p> If you're interested in our full competitive analysis, you can find it <a href="./images/submeet/Jesse Competitive Analysis.pdf" target="_BLANK">here.</a> Some of the most important insights we found from the competitive analysis included:
                        <li>Reach - Some of the website had great features that helped users find listings, but there weren't many users</li>
                        <li>Trust - Some platforms were considered more trustworthy than others, and therefore users were more likely to use them.</li>
                        <li>Payment - All platforms except Airbnb did NOT facilitate payment, only communication between subletter and subleaser. </li>

                <h4> 1 on 1 Interviews </h4>
                <p> We conducted 1 on 1 interviews to understand how people currently find subletters or subletters. Beyond user journey, we also asked interviewees about their standards regarding trust. You can find our questions <a href="./images/submeet/submeet background interview.pdf" target="_BLANK">here.</a></p>
                <h4> Key Insights</h4>
                    <li>If subletters didn't find the right subleaser, they would quit.</li>
                    <li>People were more highly likely to sublet from someone they directly knew.</li>
                    <li>People were not very likely to sublet to someone 18 and under.</li>
                    <li>Subleasers were more focused on physical space and price.</li>
