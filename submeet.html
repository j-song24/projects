          <p> Every spring, CMU students off-campus are focused on a few things: Carnival, finals and subletting. Countless subletting posts pervade Facebook and Groupme groups. Subletting has always been a persisting endeavor for college students moving out of apartments over the summer. However, homes are tremendoulsy private spaces. <br><br> How do you determine if someone is trustworthy enough to stay at your home? How do you know if the subletter will return your security deposit at the end of your stay? We wanted to find out a better way to pair subletters and subleasers by exploring the theme of trust and verification in our application design. But before we started brainstorming, we wanted to understand how CMU students currently find subletters/subleasers. </p>

          <h3> User Flows </h3>
            <p> After our interviews, we got a good glimpse of how subletters and subleasers currently find housing. The two most common methods were word of mouth and digital processes. Looking at the user flows, we noticed that the main drop-out point for both the subleaser and subletter was communication and interviewing. <br>
            <h5 class="emphasis-text center">This helped reveal a user need that fueled our design decision: Trust </h5><br>
