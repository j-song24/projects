            <p>
                Transformational Game Design Studio is a HCI course taught at Carnegie Mellon University that allows students to work with real life clients to solve real life problems through the fun of games and playful experiences.

                Task: Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, built in 1893 is one of Pittsburgh's most prized landmarks, dedicated to displaying and teaching the beauty of nature and plants. We were tasked with helping Phipps with promoting their Homegrown program in hopes of increasing community gardening. How were we going to create a game that helped players through garden planning and developing a sense of self-efficacy?

            <h4> Background Research and Theory </h4>
            <p>Motivational Theories - Transactional Model</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The main timeline of the transtheoretical theory includes: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance. One of the main barriers of precontemplation is that unsuccessful attempts can lead to demoralization. In contemplation, people weight the pros and cons of pursuing an action or a behavior. In preparation, people plan to take action in the immediate future. This leads to action and then maintenance, the idea that people grow less tempted to relapse and grow confidence in changes. Our game targets audiences who are in the contemplation and preparation stages and attempts to lead them to the action stage.</li>

            <h4> Prototypes </h4>
            <p>From our playtest in class, we realized we had two competing game ideas. A more cerebral strategy area control game and a more party-like game that encouraged players to really dig in the dirt. After a couple in-team playtests and discussions, we decided to focus on this more party-like game. We wanted to increase players interaction with the dirt and decided to bury sabotage cards within the soil for players to dig up when planting their seeds. We also thought an area control win condition would no longer suit this version. A better win condition, we theorized, was to get four spaces connected to each other. This gave players opportunities to dig and mess with each other.</p>

                <h4> Future </h4>
                <p>Occupational therapy - We would focus on improving our game towards helping with Occupational Therapy. Our game necesarily involves a lot of fine motor movement: pinching game pieces, digging into soil with fingers, "planting seedlings" and rolling up slips of paper. We think that this game can help individuals, especially children with diseases like cerebral palsy who have trouble with fine motor skills with their hands. By gamifying the occupational therapy experience, we hope that these children would have a more enjoyable time during therapy.
