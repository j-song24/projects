            <h4> Summary </h4>
            <p>Flow! Is a fun yet relaxing multiplayer stretching game with the goal of alleviating chronic pain before
                sleep.</p>

            <h4> Background </h4>
            <p>Our clients at Philips tasked our class to solve the problem of interrupted of different user groups.
                Our focus
                was to design a game for different contexts of play. We were responsible for learning about the needs
                of people
                with chronic pain and their issues around sleep. Furthermore, we defined the barriers they face and
                created a
                game that helped them sleep soundly without disturbance. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s8 offset-s2">
            <h4> User Research and Theory </h4>
            <p>Since our user group of people with chronic pain was very broad, for our initial design , we narrowed
                down our
                target group to people with periods. Many women on their periods wake up periodically throughout the
                night due
                to several factors including: fear of staining sheets, hot flashes, excruciating cramps and general
                anxiety and
                discomfort. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brainstorm and mapping - The first step we took was brainstorming our stakeholders. We wanted to
                    specify
                    who we making a game for and if there are any subsections of our user group</li>

                <img class="detail-image" src="./images/flow/concept map.png">
                <li>Guerilla research - Another one of our first steps was conducting guerilla research- we created a
                    list of
                    interview questions: When did you start having your period? What was your biggest struggle with
                    having
                    period? Why? What is the worst part of having period? Has your period ever affected your sleep?
                    How? What
                    is your coping method for these sleep problems? How did you start this coping method? To further
                    our
                    knowledge about where women felt pain on their periods, we asked women around the HCI masters
                    studio to
                    mark down areas of the body where they have pain. As indicated by the image, most people marked
                    their
                    abdomen area, some marked the back, chest, head, shoulders, quadriceps and shins.</li>

            <h4> Transformational Goal </h4>
            <p>We wanted to create a game with the transformational goal of turning an experience that's uncontrollable
                and
                painful (like a period) into one where people are able to have agency, control, and comfort over their
                own
                bodies.</p>
