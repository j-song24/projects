            <p> Large environmental displays that engage members of the public must be highly readable and easy to understand. Data-driven displays appear in sports stadiums, transportation facilities, hospitals, or stock trading floors. They create value for these transient groups of individuals by displaying the right data at the right time. </p>
            <p> The main goal is to create a clear data-driven environmental display that is placed in the Atlantis Transportation Hub. This display should promote the PTF pass, a transportation pass that allows flexible travel between the San Juan Islands. In order to achieve this goal, we needed to examine personas of stakeholders, empathize with them, and use them to inform design decisions. By analyzing a data set that contains flight, train and ferry information, we were able abstract the data and present it in a digestible way that not only creates value for the business owner but also creates value for the customer.</p>

          <p>We rapidly sketched many ideas about how we can display travel information to the users. We were able to explore a breadth of different types of data visualizations.

          <p> We knew we wanted to incorporate a map, to help those using the display quickly be able to visualize their routes and itineraries </p>
          <p>We determined that destination was the most important element of the display, when we created the future state model of the information architecture of the display.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we paid close attention to the organization & hierarchy of the data for the first iteration. For trains and planes, the direct modes of transportation from ATH, we wanted to highlight data by destination. For ferries, we wanted to highlight connecting routes from those destinations.</p>
          <blockquote class="takeaway-text">To address the stakeholder's need: flexibility, we illustrated the ease with which one can transfer from plane to train to ferry on the map. By visually representing the various routes and transit hubs, users can plan their itineraries.</blockquote>

          <p> For our second iteration we wanted to further emphasize the PTF pass.</p>
          <p>We first asked ourselves: What is the PTF Pass?</p>
          <p> We decided that the PTF pass allows for ATH customers to easily create custom/flexible itineraries among the different destinations around the San Juan Islands. The pass also eases access to the different modes of transportation (tap on/tap off, reserved seating, etc.).</p>
          <p>How does the PTF pass influence our design?</p>
          <blockquote class="takeaway-text">We wanted customers to feel as though they could travel like locals - this is reflected in the display with an easy to use map, simple data organization and neutral colors. We also wanted to help customers make travel decisions, by showing them information about the different destinations, such as weather and activities information. </blockquote>

          <p>Pirate and cartography elements were playful and visually interesting</p>
          <p>Pirate and cartography elements distracted from the important info map needed to convey.</p>

          <p>While having a unique perspective can differentiate our design from a crowd aesthetic flare should ultimately serve the goal of our display not distract from it.</p>
