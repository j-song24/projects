            <h5> Problem</h5>
            <p> Public engagement with art is correlated with improved city livability, safety, and educational achievements. However, engagement with public art has always been a challenge to measure due to the lack of traditional data such as ticket sales, membership information, and dedicated social media channels. Our goal with this project was to increase engagement with public art by leveraging technology.</p>
            <p> Despite the fact that public art should be enjoyed by all, everyday often times didn't feel underqualified to assess a piece of art. This led to our problem statement:</p>
            <blockquote class="takeaway-text"> How can we increase interpersonal connection with public art while providing a non-judgemental social platform to do so?</blockquote>

        <div class="col s12">
          <p> Based on the research we conducted, we began to brainstorm potential ideas. First, we explored a breadth of ideas through crazy 8's, then narrowed down our ideas and developed them into storyboards. </p>
          <p> When creating storyboards, we created safe, neutral and risky storyboards for each user need. They were categorized as safe, neutral, and risky based on how comfortable/uncomfortable it made the user feel. We did this in order to explore the range of a users' comfort levels and figure out which design solutions shouldn't be pursued.</p>
          <p> Our storyboards addressed these three user needs:</p>
            <li class="takeaway-text indented-text"> Need for greater sensory engagement</li>
            <li class="takeaway-text indented-text"> Need for accessibility </li>

          <p>Users validated the added value of multisensory art pieces, but expressed their dislike of mediums that go too far into multisensory mediums and overload the user.</p>
          <blockquote class="color-text">"More attention grabby ... but doesn't necessarily mean more interaction with art."</blockquote>
          <p> Users also validated the need for personal connection to an art piece. Interestingly, users expressed they felt the greatest personal connection to art when an aspect of co-creation was involved. </p>
          <blockquote class="color-text">Referring to Carnegie Museum of Art installation where every hour a photo is taken of pedestrians on the street: "It feels cool ... you feel like you are now in the museum and a piece of it."</blockquote>

          <h3> Solution </h3> 
          <p> Our solution looks to increase the connectivity people have towards public art, as well as bridge the social barriers people feel when viewing public art. By allowing users to connect public art with music, people feel more qualified to talk about art pieces, despite having non-technical knowledge about art. Adding a multisensory facet to our solution helps users not only connect visually to the art piece but also auditorily.</p>

          <h3> Takeaways </h3> 
          <p> Robust research comes with tenacity and a lot of rejections!</p>
          <p> It was a humbling experience tackling a broad and impactful research topic with important implications to the community. I found that researching about public art around Pittsburgh has helped me feel closer to the city. </p>
          <p> In the future, I would like to further iterate on this prototype and continue to test the effectiveness of the application with different demographics.</p>
          <p>(Side note: The most interesting thing I found out about a piece of public art near me was regarding the reclining figure in front of the Carnegie Museum of art. The artist's cast for the sculpture was stolen! It is believed to have been loaded into the back of a stolen Mercedes, cut up for scrap, and shipped to Rotterdam. The sculpture was estimated to be worth £3m, but only £1,500 as scrap!)</p>
